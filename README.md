# convective-rs

Distributed Convex Financial Machine Learning

## Overview

The `convective` project has a discernable-monolith approach, in the sense that can be used as a whole, or, by segrateing the modules. The categories are the following: 

## Data I/O sourcing and generation: 
- `convective-data` : Foundational Data Types and I/O integrations.
- `convective-synth` : Synthetic Data Generation (Probabilistic).

## Distributed ML with a Graph approach
- `convective-graph` : Spectral Graph Theory (types and compute).
- `convective-opers` : Workers with a quasi-agentic approach.

## Traditional Quantitative Finance
- `convective-quant` : Classic Quantitative Finance (compute).

## Implementation 
- `convective-rs` : Distributed Convex Financial Machine Learning.
